# HiveDML-ExportToFileSystem

Query results can be inserted into filesystem directories by using a slight variation of the syntax above:



```sql
# 标准语法
Standard syntax:
INSERT OVERWRITE [LOCAL] DIRECTORY directory1
  [ROW FORMAT row_format] [STORED AS file_format] (Note: Only available starting with Hive 0.11.0)
  SELECT ... FROM ...

# 多重插入 
Hive extension (multiple inserts):
FROM from_statement
INSERT OVERWRITE [LOCAL] DIRECTORY directory1 select_statement1
[INSERT OVERWRITE [LOCAL] DIRECTORY directory2 select_statement2] ...
 
  
row_format
  : DELIMITED [FIELDS TERMINATED BY char [ESCAPED BY char]] [COLLECTION ITEMS TERMINATED BY char]
        [MAP KEYS TERMINATED BY char] [LINES TERMINATED BY char]
        [NULL DEFINED AS char] (Note: Only available starting with Hive 0.13)
```
