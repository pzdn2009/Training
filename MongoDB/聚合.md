# 聚合

Aggregation operations process **data records** and return **computed results**。

Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result. 

MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: **the aggregation pipeline**, **the map-reduce function**, and **single purpose aggregation methods**.
